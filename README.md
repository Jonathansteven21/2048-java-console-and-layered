# 2048 Java â€” Console & Layered Structure

This repository contains two Java implementations of the **2048** game:  
1. **Simple Console Version** â€” All logic in one file for learning the core mechanics.  
2. **Layered Architecture Version** â€” Using **Entityâ€“Serviceâ€“Controller** structure (no frameworks) to simulate a backend architecture ready for Spring MVC.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Implement the 2048 game from scratch in Java.
- Start simple: focus on the rules, logic, and flow of the game.
- Progress to a maintainable architecture with clear separation of concerns.
- Prepare the codebase for future integration with **Spring MVC** and a **frontend**.
